# Moves

The moves are stored as 1 or 0. Since we are cynical developers, we believe that `1` means to defect, and `0` means to not defect.


# Outcomes

- If both players defect, the outcome will be coded as `1` 
- If one player defects, the outcome will be coded as `0.5` and the player id number is returned.
- If neither player defects, the outcome will be coded as `0`.
